* Simple Interaction With Amazon Q In Emacs
Transient prefix ~amazon-q-transient~ as an entry point to interact with Amazon Q from within Emacs.

Supports either using term or comint backend.

Currently the comint-backend is much more feature-full (since this is the one I mainly use)

A few niceties added:
- Fontifying code blocks (comint only for now)
- Pseudo "system prompt" via ~amazon-q-system-prompt-file~
  - be careful editing the system prompt as font locking relies on it.

WARNING: Still pretty WIP but good enough for regular use.
