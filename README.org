* Simple Interaction With Amazon Q In Emacs
Transient prefix ~amazon-q-transient~ as an entry point to interact with Amazon Q from within Emacs.

Supports either using term or comint backend.

Currently the comint-backend is much more feature-full (since this is the one I mainly use)
Initially I thought term would be easier to work with but as I got deeper into this, comint turned out to be
the nicer one to work with.
The term backend is mostly still here because of my stubbornness to try and make it work.

A few niceties added:
- Fontifying code blocks (comint only for now)
- Pseudo "system prompt" via ~amazon-q-system-prompt-file~
  - be careful editing the system prompt as font locking relies on it.


WARNING: Still pretty WIP but good enough for regular use.
